        Capacity Bay, Inc. began in 2014 with the vision of its founder Obi Nwachukwu to empower individuals and communities for 
        in-demand employments by simplifying and making easy how learning online and hands-on in a practical way from the comfort 
        of your home or office can benefit individuals and organizationsâ€”maximizing group training, promoting personalized development and more.
        Since its formation, Capacity Bay, Inc. has made meaningful strides as an innovative leader in the areas of information technology training.
        Our vision is not only to create information technology jobs and careers for people in transition and poverty but to facilitate economic and 
        social opportunity for them and their families. The Mission of Capacity Bay, Inc. is simple: build the capacity of U. S. Veterans, transitioning
         service members, New Americans, immigrants, refugees as well as others living in areas of substantial unemployment and technology deprived communities such as sub-Sahara Africa and other parts of the world.
