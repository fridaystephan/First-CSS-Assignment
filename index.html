        Regarded as one of the greatest writers of all time, Shakespeare’s works have influenced many facets of modern life, from theatre and film to literature, philosophy 
        and even the English language itself. But according to Professor Peter Holbrook, Shakespeare’s biggest – and most important – impact lies not in his works themselves,
        but in their ability to hone citizens’ capacity for reflection and critical judgement – qualities he says are vital for building robust democracies. Complex literary 
        texts such as Shakespeare’s plays are intellectually important. By engaging with challenging literature such as Shakespeare’s plays and poems, we become literate citizens
        capable of more complex thought and discussion, and stronger critical thinkers – all crucial skills in a healthy democratic society. Moreover, many people feel that the
        themes and topics of the plays – for example power and ruling class tyranny – are still relevant to contemporary ethical and political reflection.Shakespeare also crafted
        unique words like “hoodwinked” and “bedazzle”, and even created common words by changing nouns to verbs, verbs to adjectives, and so on. But, aside from his immense contribution to the English language, there are many more reasons why his work is still studied today.
